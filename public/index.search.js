    "content": "In what follows, you can find the main resources that were used while creating the database, and the rationale behind the selection. The first step was to try and assemble a list of spices that are relatively well-known, using materials and information gathered by professionals from various fields. The second step was to collate information on these materials, standardize our “master list”, and conduct research on each. Along the way, new and less common materials would reveal themselves, and their addition would help the ultimate goal of an exhaustive, comprehensive list of spices.\nEncyclopedias are a good starting point in any topic, and the Encyclopaedia Britannica does have a list of herbs and spices. Regarding the realm of plants, we relied on the book of South African botanist Ben-Erik van Wyk. For cultural and historical account, we turned towards the book of English historian and linguist Andrew Dalby. Finally, for a perspective from the culinary arts we used the book of Tony Hill, a spice merchant from Seattle.\nSource Field Number of items Petruzzello (\rCitation: 2023 Petruzzello, \rM.\r \r(2023).\r \rList of herbs and spices.\r Retrieved from \rhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-herbs-and-spices-2024392\r)\rReference 70 Hill (\rCitation: 2004 Hill, \rT. \r(2004).\r \rThe contemporary encyclopedia of herbs and spices: Seasonings for the global kitchen.\r \rJ.

Ancient Greek ἀρωματικός arōmatikós adj. ‘aromatic’, and the etymon ἄρωμα árōma n. “aromatic herb or spice” (Liddell–Scott–Jones, 1843).\nThe term therefore refers to any substance of fragrance, focusing on spices, but also including, oils and perfume, incense, fragrant woods, medicine, and other aromatic exotica with special olfactory and gustatory qualities.\nVersioning \u0026 Updates Version0.0.1 (2023-08-01) website creation; entering development mode (alpha)\nobjects considered interesting because they are out of the ordinary, especially because they originated in a distant foreign country ↩︎\n",
