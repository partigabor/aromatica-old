    "content": "In what follows, you can find the main resources that were used while building the database, and the rationale behind the selections.\n1. A Master List of Spices The first step was to create a list of spices that are relatively well-known, using information gathered by professionals from various fields. The second step was to collate the data on these materials, and morph it into a unified database to faciliate further enquiries. In the later stages of researching specific items, new and less common substances would reveal themselves, and their addition will help to reach the ultimate goal of a comprehensive list of spices.\nEncyclopedias can be a great starting point to kick off research in any topic, and the Encyclopaedia Britannica does have a non-exhaustive list of herbs and spices assembled by Melissa Petruzzello (\rCitation: 2023 Petruzzello, \rM.\r \r(2023).\r \rList of herbs and spices.\r Retrieved from \rhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-herbs-and-spices-2024392\r)\r. I consider three academic fields crucial for research into the spice domain: botany, history, and gastronomy. Regarding the realm of plants, I relied on the book of South African botanist Ben-Erik van Wyk (\rCitation: 2014 Wyk, \rB. \r(2014).\r \rCulinary herbs and spices of the world.\r \rUniversity of Chicago Press, joint publication with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.\rhttps://doi.org/10.7208/chicago/9780226091839.001.0001\r)\r. For a cultural and historical account, I turned towards the book of English historian and linguist Andrew Dalby (\rCitation: 2000 Dalby, \rA. \r(2000).\r \rDangerous tastes: The story of spices.\r \rUniversity of California Press. Retrieved from \rhttps://www.worldcat.org/title/44979585\r)\r. Finally, for a perspective from the culinary arts I used the book of Tony Hill (\rCitation: 2004 Hill, \rT. \r(2004).\r \rThe contemporary encyclopedia of herbs and spices: Seasonings for the global kitchen.\r \rJ. Wiley.\r)\r, a spice merchant from Seattle.\n**Table 1.** The main resources used for the spice list, and the number of items found in each.\rSource Field Number of items Petruzzello (\rCitation: 2023 Petruzzello, \rM.\r \r(2023).\r \rList of herbs and spices.\r Retrieved from \rhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-herbs-and-spices-2024392\r)\rReference 70 Hill (\rCitation: 2004 Hill, \rT. \r(2004).\r \rThe contemporary encyclopedia of herbs and spices: Seasonings for the global kitchen.\r \rJ.

Depending on scientific discipline, sources identify spices either by the binomial name of the species, common names, or even some general culinary/medicinal functions and uses. Binomial names are the safe way to go when we talk about the plants, but differentiating certain spices that might or might not be of the same flora can be challenging, not to mention trying to navigate historical data. Common names are almost always problematic, since many spices have many distinct names and name variations in different times, and they are often confused – especially so in multilingual settings. Moreover, the information complied by experts of a certain scientific field is vastly different in nature, focusing on botany, chemistry, history, economics, gastronomy, etc. The problematics of spice identification is due to the fact that different disciplines focus on different aspects of these fascinating subjects of study: the magnifying glass of the botanist, the zeal of the historian, and the needs of the chefs are all enormously diverse perspectives.\nBibliography Dalby\r(2000)\rDalby, \rA. \r(2000).\r \rDangerous tastes: The story of spices.\r \rUniversity of California Press.

Ancient Greek ἀρωματικός arōmatikós adj. ‘aromatic’, and the etymon ἄρωμα árōma n. “aromatic herb or spice” (Liddell–Scott–Jones, 1843).\nThe term therefore refers to any substance of fragrance, focusing on spices, but also including, oils and perfume, incense, fragrant woods, medicine, and other aromatic exotica with special olfactory and gustatory qualities.\nVersioning \u0026 Updates Version0.0.1 (2023-08-01) website creation; entering development mode (alpha)\nobjects considered interesting because they are out of the ordinary, especially because they originated in a distant foreign country ↩︎\n",
