% Cinnamon is a spice, well-known around the world for its sweet aroma and flavour, obtained from trees in the \textit{Cinnamomum} genus. In fact, cinnamon does not come from just one tree, it is acquired from the inner barks of multiple species. During its several thousand years history of human use and consumption across various cultures, knowledge and understanding regarding the origins of this once highly prized product often pertained to confusion and mystery. 

% One of the reasons for this perplexity, is that cinnamon was, and still is often confused with cassia. Evidently, the two products have a high degree of resemblance and their methods of procurement are identical -- they are essentially the two main varieties of a tropical evergreen plant: \textit{Cinnamomum verum} J.Presl\footnote{http://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/463752-1}, literally "true cinnamon" (also known as \textit{C. zeylanicum} Blume "Ceylon cinnamon") and \textit{Cinnamomum cassia} (L.) J.Presl\footnote{http://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/77109079-1; http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/record/kew-2721201} "Cassia cinnamon*" (also known as \textit{C. aromaticum} among other names.

% It is hard to navigate between the hundreds of species and subspecies of cinnamon and their overlapping botanical taxons and binomial synonyms, \textit{C. verum} for example has 51 botanical synonyms, mainly a result of botanical history and competing naturalists. The main difference between the two species (besides certain varying characteristics of taste) are geographic. Cinnamon is native to Ceylon (Sri Lanka), while cassia originates from southern China, therefore often called "Chinese cinnamon" and "Chinese cassia". We believe it is impossible to discuss cinnamon without discussing cassia as well, since the two are often interchanged (in discourse, and in the kitchen), and the term cinnamon sometimes refers to species of both cinnamon and cassia. Besides the two main varieties mentioned above, there are many other popular species in the \textit{Cinnamomum} genus, including Indonesian cinnamon (\textit{C. burmanni}\footnote{http://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/463328-1}) and Saigon cinnamon or Vietnamese cinnamon (\textit{C. loureiroi}\footnote{http://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/463519-1}). over 200 accepted species are listed in the database of Plants of the World Online (POWO).

% The aim of this article is to dispel some of this uncertainty from a historical and linguistic perspective, while trying to give an account of etymological knowledge in several languages.
