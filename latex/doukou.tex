\section{Introduction}

Cardamom is a popular spice with a history spanning thousands of years of culinary and medicinal use; the reader might recall the vibrant aroma of the bright green pods. Less well-known is the fact however, that the name \textit{cardamom} can refer to multiple different kinds of fragrant fruits, besides the familiar seed pods of the ``true cardamom'', \textit{Elettaria cardamomum}. Furthermore, delving deeper into the intricacies of cardamoms from an Asian perspective reveals a complex array of words and materials, as many prototypical cardamoms grown in various regions (e.g., Himalayas, Indochina, Java, Yunnan) are botanically distinct species, and their names and identities have become entangled along the paths of diffusion.

In this study, we examine the situation in Chinese, where the corresponding word is \tc{豆蔻} \textit{dòukòu} -- also referring to another important spice, nutmeg. Similarly to its equivalent in English, \textit{dòukòu} acts as an umbrella term that can refer to any of a number of cardamom-type fruits and other closely associated spices, its precise meaning defined by regional and dialectal actualities, and narrowed by modifying \hl{adjectives}.

The main objective of this paper is to offer a novel etymological explanation for the Chinese term \textit{dòukòu} `cardamom; nutmeg', and explore its potential trade-language origins. We posit that this term is a loanword that may have been incorporated into Chinese via Southern Min, originating from a yet unidentified Indian Ocean trade-language that was in use along the ancient Maritime Silk Road during the Tang dynasty (618--907), when this term first appears in written records. Our research suggests that this word entered the Chinese lexicon alongside the economic products it denotes, and underwent phono-semantic matching that masks its foreign origin. 

In Section \ref{sec:etymology}, we present our reasoning in four main points, outlining our observations on 1) the earliest written records, 2) character composition, 3) available lexicographical data, and 4) an overview of seemingly related regional \textit{Wanderwörter} (wandering loanwords) from the Indian Ocean world, as evidence supporting our hypothesis. Following the elucidation of the lexicogenesis of this term, we examine potential candidate etymons, such as Prakrit and Arabic, discuss the linguistic and historical plausibility of our claims, and acknowledge the limitations.

% Tamil?
% something about history?

% \textit{Dòukòu} first appears as \textit{báidòukòu} [white-cardamom] in a Tang-era miscellany called \textit{Youyang Zazu}, where it is reported to come from the land of \hl{Kakkola}, describing the white, round cardamoms of (\textit{Wurfbainia vera} or \textit{Wurfbainia compacta}) originally sourced either from Siam or Java. According to this 9th-century source, the spice is called \tc{多骨} \textit{duōgǔ}, and the perceived Middle Chinese pronunciation, /tɑ-kuət̚/ ??, makes possible for it to be a sinicized transcription of an \hl{Indo-Aryan} word, e.g., from Prakrit. On the other hand, the same does not apply for \tc{豆蔻} \textit{dòukòu}, whose Middle Chinese pronunciation would be /dəuH-həuH/ ??. 

% personal communication, August 17, 2022

% As an alternative, we propose that \textit{dòukòu} could be a loan via Southern Min. Based on Kwok's reconstruction of Proto-Southern-Min, the equivalent of \textit{dòukòu} would be /*tɑu-khɑu/ \parencite{kwok_2018_southern}, more similar to the Indic words in question. 

% This is historically plausible, given that Fujian was in direct contact with the maritime traders responsible for the bulk of the spice trade, and that Sanskrit was one of the main languages of the Srivijaya Empire encompassing Kakkola around this time. In this brief etymological study, we clear the air around cardamom nomenclature, and reveal a possible trace that Fujianese traders have left on modern Chinese. This is not only interesting in terms of food history, but also in terms of the linguistic history of Chinese, as few loanwords from Southern Min have made their way into Middle Chinese.

The paper also seeks to clarify the situation surrounding the multitude of cardamoms in Asia, focusing on their identities, origins, and terminologies within a Chinese context. As it was just mentioned above, the meaning of the word \textit{dòukòu} itself can be ambiguous, and has been so since its earliest emergence, as it can refer to several different aromatic fruits and seeds. Therefore, we begin with a brief introduction to what cardamoms are, identifying the relevant plants and products known in Asia, accompanying with their nomenclature in Chinese. This will establish a foundation for our linguistic inquiries that is based on geobotanical realities.



\section{The cardamom conondrum}\label{sec:plants}

\subsection{What is cardamom?}

What people mean by the name \textit{cardamom} depends on who we ask, where we are, and in what language we are operating -- for the word \textit{cardamom} and its translations can denote multiple different spices. In all cases, this name will refer to an aromatic plant yielding a culinary and medicinal spice, and in all likelihood, most readers will think of the green, dried fruits seen in Figure \ref{fig:cardamoms}.

In Europe, the Middle East, India, and many other parts of the world, \textit{cardamom} typically refers to the seed pods of \textit{Elettaria cardamomum} (L.) Maton,\footnote{\textit{Elettaria cardamomum} in Plants of the World Online \parencite{powo}: \url{https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/796556-1}} which is an aromatic flowering plant in the ginger family (\textit{Zingiberaceae}) -- see Figure \ref{fig:plant}. It is native to India's Western Ghats, the mountain range streching along the Malabar coast of Kerala. This is the same region where black pepper hails from, and in an Indian context they are often called ``the king and queen of spices'' -- cardamom being the queen \parencite{nair_2020_geographya}. 

It is a well-known culinary spice with a long history of commerce, also used in the infusion of beverages and perfumery. Think of Indian cuisine, Arabic coffee, Egyptian perfumes, etc. Cardamom has been in use in India since the Vedic period and was traded to and through Mesopotamia since the Bronze Age \parencite{ravindran_2002_cardamom}. 

In Europe, cardamom has been known since antiquity and used as medicine. Greek physicians, such as Dioscorides and Galen, have documented its healing properties, in some cases even correctly identifying India as its place of origin \parencites{parry_1969_spices}{anderson_2023_history}. Historiographers Theophrastus and Pliny (the Elder) described two types of cardamom: the superior καρδάμωμον \textit{kardámōmon} (\textit{E. cardamomum}) and the inferior ἄμωμον \textit{ámōmon} we now mostly call ``black cardamom'' (\textit{Amomum subulatum}) \parencite{prance_2005_cultural}, the latter of which has since lost its prevalence in Europe. During the Middle Ages, cardamom was traded in the Mediterranean primarily by Arab merchants to Venice, a monopoly broken by the Portuguese in the 16\textsuperscript{th} century, who established direct trade with the Malabar coast \parencite{cumo_2013_encyclopedia}. In his 1596 \textit{Itinerario}, Dutchman Linschoten reported ``lesser'' and ``greater'' cardamoms being used in south India, corresponding to the smaller green cardamoms, and the larger black cardamoms mentioned above \parencite{nair_2006_agronomy}.

% In China, cardamoms are exotic or semi exotic, Chinese sources feature significant trade in cardamoms during the Song dynasty (960--1279) \parencite{prance_2005_cultural}.

Cardamom is still valuable today, it is the 3\textsuperscript{rd} most expensive spice after saffron and vanilla, and it is also known as \textit{green cardamom} and \textit{true cardamom}. 

\subsection{False cardamoms}

Now, the name \textit{true cardamom} implies the existence of ``false'' ones, which is not so unusual in English spice nomenclature; it can happen for two reasons. First, the term \textit{false} and its synonyms are typically used to designate alternative economic products (cf. \textit{false peppers}). Second, they hint at practices of adulteration (cf. \textit{bastard saffron}). As one of the strategies employed to distinguish spices is by using a marker of authenticity, words, such as \textit{true, real, false, fake, bastard} can occur in vernacular names. In our case, the former holds true: there are at least a dozen other spice-bearing aromatic plants in the ginger family referred to as \textit{cardamoms}, two of which we have already mentioned. Until very recently, almost all cardamom-like plants were neatly sorted into two genera, the genus \textit{Amomum} with a native range spanning from South to Southeast Asia, and the genus \textit{Aframomum} distributed in Africa. Today, many of them boast with new and revised scientific names, which can make their discussion quite overwhelming.\footnote{Modern taxonomic classification of plants started with \textcite{linnaeus_1758_systema}, but it is still developing to this day -- English botanist Burkill have already lamented on the ``unwelcome'' renaming of some cardamom species almost a hundred years ago \parencite[see][]{burkill_1930_cardamoms}.}

So, why are these other spices called \textit{cardamoms} as well? In short, these plants and their products are named \textit{cardamoms} because of their physical, chemical, and functional similarity to a prototype spice, especially in one distinct feature: they are all aromatic seed pods containing small seeds. The compact fruits' shared morphology is distinctivie enough to warrant association with an already known item, which influences the naming of newly acquired and encountered spices. In a western context, the prototype spice is the green cardamom we know (\textit{E. cardamomum}), hence the name \textit{true cardamom}. We take the idea of a ``prototype spice'' from the prototype theory in cognitive science, as this seems to illuminate best the categorization and naming practices of new spices during acculturation \parencite[see][]{parti_2023_mapping}.

To clarify, false cardamoms are not fake, what is considered ``false'' is determined by the predominant prototype spice in a given culture (whether it is indigenous to the region, or the first of its kind encountered), and the perceived value of the spice affected by notions of quality and scarcity. For instance, true cinnamon from Ceylon has historically been regarded as superior to cassia or Chinese cinnamon, leading to the use of names such as \textit{true cinnamon} (even dictating the binomial name \textit{Cinnamomum verum}, meaning `true cinnamon' in Latin) and \textit{bastard cinnamon}.

\end{table}

While for many of the concept of cardamom is synonymous with the dried, green, camphorous seed pods, there are regions in Asia where the ``default'' cardamom looks and tastes a bit different. In the Eastern Himalayas (Nepal, Bhutan, Northeast India, Bengal) we find \textit{Amomum subulatum} Roxb., the smoky \textit{black cardamom}, also known as  \textit{greater cardamom}, \textit{brown cardamom}, \textit{Nepal cardamom}, \textit{Indian (black) cardamom}, \textit{Bengal cardamom}, \textit{false cardamom}, \textit{hill cardamom}, \textit{winged cardamom}, etc. In Yunnan, Southwestern China and Vietnam there is the even larger \textit{Lanxangia tsao-ko} (Crevost \& Lemarié) M.F.Newman \& Skornick. syn. \textit{A. hongtsaoko} Liang et Fang; \textit{A. tsao-ko} Crevost et Lemaire, known as \textit{Chinese black cardamom}, \textit{tsaoko cardamom}, or simply \textit{tsaoko}. Southeast Asia has two species that yield little, white, round cardamoms: \textit{Wurfbainia vera} (Blackw.) Škorničk. \& A.D.Poulsen syn. \textit{A. krervanh/kravanh} Pierre ex Gagnep\footnote{Initially known as \textit{A. verum} Blackw., this is the first plant species to be named by a woman, Elizabeth Blackwell, in 1757.} mainly grown in the Cardamom Mountains of Cambodia, commonly known as \textit{round cardamom}, \textit{white cardamom}, \textit{Siam cardamom}, or \textit{krervanh}, and \textit{Wurfbainia compacta} (Sol. ex Maton) Škorničk. \& A.D.Poulsen syn. \textit{A. compactum} Sol. ex Maton; \textit{A. kepulaga} Sprague \& Burkill, growing in Indonesia known as \textit{round cardamom}, \textit{Java round cardamom}, \textit{Indonesian cardamom}, and \textit{kepulaga}. 

Less important spice-yielding plants include \textit{Wurfbainia villosa} (Lour.) Škorničk. \& A.D.Poulsen syn. \textit{A. villosum} Lour., know as \textit{Tavoy cardamom}
% (after a city in Myanmar, Dawei)
, and \textit{wild Siamese cardamom} among other names. See a concise overview of these taxons in Table \ref{tab:cardamoms}.

Please notice the numerous common names for each spice. These, and their endless permutations can be a headache, but also quite revealing -- vernacular names contain references to the prototype spice, modified with an adjective of color, a place of origin, or some other salient feature; occasionally using a \hl{local/native} name.


% The following is a list of common names for various cardamoms (including those found in Africa) collected from botanical, historical, and culinary literature \parencites{dalby_2000_dangerous}{prance_2005_cultural}{vanwyk_2014_culinary} {hill_2004_contemporary}{anderson_2023_history}.

% The purpose of this selection here is to illustrate what a prototype spice means for the naming of other, similar exotic items: the word \textit{cardamom} is used as a prototype word in the generation of names for novel spices, it anchors new and unfamiliar items.

Now that we are familiar with the most important spice plants in Asia that define local or regional culinary traditions as prototypical cardamoms, we can zone in on our main goal, and we can pose the following question: What is the ``default'', prototypical cardamom in China? Which one of these can be reffered to as \textit{dòukòu} in Chinese?

% TCM databases: white cardamom
% Google image search?
% Baidu?

\subsection{Chinese cardamoms}


The answer is: a few of these, and more. In a Chinese context we have the black cardamom of the Himalayas (\textit{A. subulatum}) called \textit{xiāngdòukòu} [fragrant cardamom], the two white cardamoms of maritime and mainland Southeast Asia, respectively Javanese cardamom (\textit{W. compacta}) -- \textit{zhǎowā
báidòukòu} [Java-white-cardamom], and Siam cardamom (\textit{W. vera}) -- \textit{báidòukòu} [white-cardamom], and the not so well-known green fruits of \textit{E. cardamomum}. Green cardamom as a culinary spice is \hl{virtually unknown} in China, however \textcite{hu_2005_food} notes that it is available in Hong Kong markets, used by ``Indian and Portuguese residents especially'', and that it grown and consumed medicinally in the Southern provinces. It is usually called \textit{xiǎodòukòu} `small cardamom' in Chinese Herbal Medicine, but \textit{lǜdòukòu} `green cardamom' is also in use.

Tsaoko cardamom and Tavoy cardamom both fell out of the \textit{dòukòu} basket, tsako is simply \textit{cǎoguǒ} [herb-fruit] -- hence the English name, and Tavoy cardamom is \textit{shārén} [granule-kernel] -- a name suggestive of its compact fruit. In Hong Kong, \tc{青砂仁} \textit{qīngshā​rén} `green \textit{shārén}' also exists, referring to green cardamoms.

% What about 香砂仁

Additionally, we also have three new materials that utilize the word \textit{dòukòu} in Chinese. First, there is the dried, date-like fruits of greater galangal (\textit{Alpinia galanga}) which is mostly known for its fragrant rhizome and \hl{dominance} in Thai cooking. It is simply called \textit{hóngdòukòu} `red cardamom' in Chinese. Then, we have the semi-exotic fruits of \textit{Alpinia hainanensis} resembling tiny brains, called \textit{cǎodòukòu} `herb cardamom' and Anglicized as \textit{katsumada galangal seed} on Chinese Herbal Medicine databases \parencite[cf.][]{polyu_2022_chinese}. This plant is better known in the West for its attractive pink flowers, under the name Hainan galangal. Finally, there is nutmeg, the seed of a tree from an unrelated species, \textit{Myristica fragrans}, in a different plant family. Nutmeg is native to the Maluku islands of Indonesia, which were famously known as the Spice Islands during colonial times. Until the 18\textsuperscript{th} century, nutmeg and its companion, mace, were only grown here, and they were one of the most highly prized products of the spice trade primarliy due to their reputation to ward off the plague ??.
% in the 14\textsuperscript{th} century. 
%With half a kilo being equivalent to the cost of a house in London. 
Nutmeg in Chinese is called \textit{ròudòukòu} [flesh-cardamom], which translates to 'meaty cardamom', while mace is \textit{ròudòukòupí}	[flesh-cardamom-skin].

In Chinese, \textit{dòukòu} operates similarly to English \textit{cardamom}; at least on a pragmatic level if not botanically. It is a generic term that tends to be combined with additional modifiers of color, place, or other features to narrow down its meaning. Mirroring the use of modifiers in English, a formula $x~cardamom = x~doukou$ can be observed. Table \ref{tab:doukous} displays the various spices that incorporate the word \textit{dòukòu} in their names.

\section{The etymology of \textit{dòukòu}}\label{sec:etymology}

Scholars have a reatively good understanding of the etymology of the English word \textit{cardamom}, but the exact origins are still obscure. Basically, the word \textit{cardamom} entered English from via Old French and Latin, from a Greek word, beyond which experts suspect a Pre-Greek source \parencite{beekes_2010_etymological}. Stages in this word's history are usually reconstructed along the following lines:

\begin{quote}
    \textbf{English} \textit{cardamom} `cardamom' ca. 1425, via \textbf{post-classical Latin} \textit{cardimomum}, a. 1398; 
    later also from \textbf{Old French} \textit{cardemome} `cardamom', ca. 1170
    < \textbf{Latin} \textit{cardamōmum} `cardamom', 1st c. AD
    < \textbf{Hellenistic Greek} {καρδάμωμον} \textit{kardámōmon} `cardamom', haplological κάρδαμ- \textit{kárdam-} `cress' + ἄμωμον \textit{ámōmon} `an Indian spice plant', 3rd c. BC
    < \textbf{Ancient Greek} {κάρδαμον} \textit{kárdamon} `garden cress, \textit{Lepidium sativum}', prehaps a loanword (many plant names with \textit{-amon} are clear loanwords; the suffIx \textit{-amon} is known from Pre-Greek), ultimately of uncertain origin, 4th c. BC 
    %; cf. cognates classical Latin \textit{cardamum}
    \parencites[s.v. cardamom]{oed}[s.v. cardamome]{tlfi}[s.v. cardamomum]{lewis_1879_latin}[s.v. καρδάμωμον]{liddell_1940_greekenglish}[s.v. κάρδαμον]{liddell_1940_greekenglish}[644]{beekes_2010_etymological}
\end{quote}

% Kárdamon was identified with the word 𐀏𐀅𐀖𐀊 ka-da-mi-ja 41 , (kardamia as a feminine form of kardamon) appearing on Mycenaean tablets listing spices in Linear B, excavated in the “House of the Sphinxes” in 1950s, and dated to the 1200s bc (Bennett et al., 1958, p. 107).

% this is how linguists usually reconstruct word histories: tracing word stages step by step. 

% And may or may not appear on Mycenaean stone tablets written in Linear B over 3000 years ago, it is outside of my specialty to judge these claims. It is quite difficult to be sure about the source of a word at this time-depth, almost 3000 years ago.

Let us now turn towards the etymology of \textit{dòukòu}. During our research, we came across various pieces of evidence that led us to believe that \textit{dòukòu} might be a loanword as well, we will now present our observations in four main points and explain what these pieces of information entail...

The first elaborate mention of \tc{豆蔻} \textit{dòukòu} is from a 9\textsuperscript{th}-century book called \tc{酉陽雜俎} \textit{Youyang Zazu} [\textit{Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang}], which is a Tang era miscellany of tall tales and legends, strange phenomena, fantastic creatures, and exotic products, but also serves as an excellent source of historical data. The work was collated by Duan Chengsi (d. 863). In chapter\footnote{Technically \textit{juàn}, meaning `scroll' or `fascicle'} 18, the author discusses 24 foreign plants that have been imported to China or brought as tribute from faraway places, such as Magadha (in India), Malaysia, Persia, Silla (Korea), and Syria. Elevating the resource's usefulness, Duan often reports the local names for non-native plants and products and usually compares them to something more familiar to his Chinese readership. The mentioned chapter describes acacia, Balm of Giliad, galbanum, jackfruit, jasmine, and narcissus, among others \parencite{reed_2003_tang}; section 55 tells us about cardamom. The text is accessible via the Chinese Text Project\footnote{\url{https://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=en&chapter=801324}} \parencite{sturgeon_2021_chinese}, translation is provided by the authors.

After stating the place of origin and its name, the author proceeds to describe the plant's morphology: its height, its leaves, its yellow flowers, compares the shape of the fruits to grapes (also a non-native plant in China), and puts the time of harvest to the seventh month of the calendar.

The fist obvious question about the segment is: Why is it ``white'' cardamom? Or to put it more precisely, why does cardamom have a modifier when it is one of the first attested instance we have of this word? According to \textcite[22]{donkin_2003_east}, the Chinese first confused nutmeg and cardamom (presumably round cardamom), ``doubtless on account of a resemblance between their fruits.'' We know that in the earliest sources, both spices were referred to as \textit{dòukòu} \parencites{hsu_1967_notes}{donkin_2003_east}. Both nutmeg and the white round cardamoms were sourced from mainland Southeast Asia, and then carried up to the Tang courts on ships from Kakola \parencite[184-185]{schafer_1985_golden}. This place also appears in Ibn Battuta \parencite{dunn_1986_adventures}



To avoid nomenclatural confusion, nutmeg became 肉豆蔻 ròudòukòu, cardamom became 白豆蔻 báidòukòu.
This mix-up exists in other languages as well!

According to Donkin, the Chinese first confused nutmeg with cardamom, on account of their similar fruits, and at some point both imported spices were called doukou.
Furthermore, both were sourced from mainland Southeast Asia, likely traded on the same trade routes, and the same ships, ((He says that, nutmeg was known in Chinese as kakola (ca. 725), and later as doukou (ca. 863), roudoukou is the name in later sources, including an illustrated herbal of 1062 (1249).))
So, to avoid confusion nutmeg became roudoukou – flesh cardamom – while the round cardamoms became baidoukou – white cardamom.
As many scholars noticed before, the confusion is not limited to Chinese.

((Nutmeg: “chia-kou-le” (ca. 725), as “to-ku” (ca. 863). “jou-tou-k’ou” (ca. 1062)
White cardamom: “tou-k’ou”, “pai-tou-k’ou” (Hsü, 1967; Donkin, 2003)))

\subsection{Character characteristics}

Our word under scrutiny is made up of two characters, \tc{豆} \textit{dòu} and \tc{蔻} \textit{kòu}. \textit{Dòu} is relatively straightforward, in dictionaries you can find definitions, such as `bean'; `pod-bearing plant or its seeds'; `bean-shaped object'; etc. ?? \textit{Kòu} on the other hand is much more specific, and dictionary entries usually direct the reader to other entries where the character is used, e.g., `used in 豆蔻'; `see豆蔻 nutmeg, cardamom'; etc. ?? The case in point here is that \textit{kòu} does not mean anything else, and it does not appear in other word, which is rare for a Chinese character. 

\tc{蔻} \textit{kòu} is made up of the radical for grass, \tc{艹} \textit{cǎo} `grass, herb' ??, and a phonetic component \tc{寇} \textit{kòu} meaning `bandit' which is a typical phono-semantic compound in Chinese. This sinogram however does not seem to exist before its emergence in the word for the spices, there is no record of \tc{蔻} \textit{kòu} before the 9th century. Was this character created for this purpose? It seems so. And if yes, then where does the \hl{/kou/ sound} come from? We think it is likely a loanword.

Furthermore, doukou often appears in a form ?? where the first character too has the grass radical on top (i.e., \tc{荳蔻}). Featuring the grass radical on both characters seems to be a typical device in the naming foreign edible plants, often loanwords themselves. Cf. the Chinese words \tc{草莓} \textit{cǎoméi} `strawberry', \tc{菠菜} \textit{bōcài} `spinach', and an archaic\footnote{The modern word for cumin, \tc{孜然} \textit{zī​rán} comes via Uyghur, \hl{from Sanskrit?}} word for `cumin', \tc{蒔蘿} \textit{shíluó} `cumin'.

\subsection{Lexicographical clues}

Youwei Shi (2021) Loanwords in the Chinese Language. Routledge:
	“Doukou 豆蔻, meaning cardamom, introduced to China in the 	Tang dynasty, probably originated from Arabic takur, related to 	the name of the ancient port Takola.” (p. 44)
No Arabic word like takur
Points to a place: Takola.

---

So, I tried to check what the dictionary says. Chinese is one the few major languages with no authoritative etymological dictionary, but there are some works on loanwords in Chinese. The most recent publication on this topic has an entry on doukou, and it says: 
…
This sounds like an crucial claim to push our investigation forward, 
but sadly, Arabic does not have a word that sounds or looks like takur
it does on the other hand point to an ancient port: Takola, which sounds awfully familiar to Kakola.





\subsection{The sea of kakkola/takkola type words}

Arabic قاقلة qāqulla ‘cardamom’ < Aramaic < Akkadian < Sanskrit?
Sanskrit कक्कोल kakkola ‘species of plant (bearing a berry, the inner part of which is waxy and aromatic’/ तक्कोल takkola *‘Pimenta acris’ (Monier-Williams, 1899, pp. 241, 431)
Pali takkola ‘perfume made from an aromatic berry’ (Pali Text Society, 1921–1925, p. 292),
Tibetan ཀ་ཀོ་ལ kakola ‘black cardamom’ (Amomum tsao-ko) (Goldstein et al., 2001, p. 1), 嘎哥拉 gágēlā in Eastern Tibet (Hu, 2005)
Javanese ꦏꦥꦸꦭꦒ kapulaga?, Malay pelaga? …etc.
Kakola (Chinese: Kakula, Arabic: Qāqulla) was a trading emporion on the western coast of Malay peninsula known in Ancient Greece as Takola of the golden Chersonese in Ptolemy’s Geography, AD 2nd c., and Talaitakkōlam in Tamil based on inscriptions from Chōla expeditions, AD 10th c. (Wheatley, 1961, p. 270).

---

There is an Arabic word for cardamom, qāqulla, which is not a native word. It is usually traced back to Sanskrit via Aramaic and Akkadian.
Looking up the Sanskrit word will send us down a rabbit hole about kakkola/takkola, a word that is the proposed etymon for others, such as Pali takkola, Tibetan kakola, and many more, including Javanese and Malay.
Kakola has been identified as Takola, an old trading emporion on the western coast of the Malay peninsula, already known to Ancient Greek geographers like Ptolemy, and also recorded in Tamil inscriptions of Chola expeditions.
The 4th reason therefore is about a regional review of seemingly related words, the technical word for these are Wanderwort of Kulturwort using German. 


(Just as the use of cinnamon may have led to the discovery of cloves, so one or other of the many cardamoms grown in South China and mainland South East Asia probably predisposed the Chinese to the imported nutmeg Takkola (Chinese Ko-ku-lo, Arabic) was a place or region on the west coast of Malaya,170 which the Chinese from the eighth century thought produced both nutmegs and the round cardamom (Amomum kepulaga), the latter possibly introduced from Java.171)



Other people have already noticed this before. Here is a collection of all the takkola/kakkola type words around the Indian Ocean world; the words usually have the sense of some aromatic substance or spice. 
Historians place the ancient port of Takola here, marked with the red dot, and we know from Chinese sources that the Chinese have imported products from here, so
Now the question is: Could 豆蔻 dòukòu be an eponymous loan related to one of these names? Could this transmission happen?
