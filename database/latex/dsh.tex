\section{Introduction}

Spices in the historical sense not only amount to dried plant parts, they also constitute a set of cultural items. 

only comprise the aromatic parts of plants, but also include other plant products that were used for flavoring, preserving, and coloring food. In this paper, we will focus on the linguistic and geographic diffusion of spices, referring to how various spice names have spread around the globe - together with the materials/products. The work is philological, and it will focus on the etymologies of 24 spice words in English, e.g.: pepper, cumin, cardamom, coriander, ginger, clove, turmeric, cinnamon, etc. We will trace these words and through this, we can track the journey of the materials. We also want to refer to related historical times and civilizations that acted as donor languages in these words' history, e.g. Arabia, Southeast Asia, India, etc. Our main hypothesis is that along their diffusion in early global trade, these materials have left a continuous linguistic trail, which then serves as evidence for their journey even at time-depths where written or archeological evidence is not available. The research question would be: can looking at the words help and tell us the history and journey really? The conclusion then would be something about how our world and foods are interconnected for thousands of years.







Introduction:
Present the context of your research in Digital Humanities and the significance of studying spice word etymologies.
Introduce the research question and the main hypothesis.
Briefly outline the structure of the paper.

Question

I would like to ask for advice on how to structure an academic paper. The field is Digital Humanities, and the targeted journal is called Scholarship in the Digital Humanities. I want to write about the linguistic (and geographic) diffusion of spices, referring to how various spice names have spread around the globe - together with the materials/products. The work is philological, and it will focus on the etymologies of 24 spice words in English, e.g.: pepper, cumin, cardamom, coriander, ginger, clove, turmeric, cinnamon, etc. I will trace these words and through this, we can track the journey of the materials. I also want to refer to related historical times and civilizations that acted as donor languages in these words' history, e.g. Arabia, Southeast Asia, India, etc. Our main hypothesis is that along their diffusion in early global trade, these materials have left a continuous linguistic trail, which then serves as evidence for their journey even at time-depths where written or archeological evidence is not available. The research question would be: can looking at the words help and tell us the history and journey really? The conclusion then would be something about how our world and foods are interconnected for thousands of years. How would I structure such a paper?

Answer

Structuring an academic paper for a journal in Digital Humanities, like "Scholarship in the Digital Humanities," to investigate the linguistic and geographic diffusion of spices, with a focus on etymologies of spice words, is a complex task. Here's a suggested structure for your paper:

    Title: Start with a clear, concise, and engaging title that reflects the main topic of your research, such as "Tracing the Linguistic and Geographic Diffusion of Spices: A Philological Exploration of Spice Etymologies."

    Abstract: Provide a brief summary of your paper, including the research question, methods, key findings, and implications. This should be around 150-250 words.

    Introduction:
        Present the context of your research in Digital Humanities and the significance of studying spice word etymologies.
        Introduce the research question and the main hypothesis.
        Briefly outline the structure of the paper.

    Literature Review:
        Discuss existing literature on spice diffusion, the history of spice trade, linguistic anthropology, and etymology studies.
        Highlight gaps in the literature that your research aims to address.

    Methodology:
        Explain your research methods, focusing on how you traced the etymology of 24 spice words.
        Describe the linguistic and historical databases, tools, and resources you used for your analysis.
        Discuss how you intend to use maps and visualizations in your research.

    Data Collection:
        Present the 24 spice words you are studying and their etymological information.
        Explain your criteria for selecting these words.
        Describe how you collected linguistic data for each word and any challenges encountered during the process.

    Analysis:
        Explore the historical and linguistic journey of each spice word, tracing its origins and the languages it passed through.
        Discuss the historical contexts and civilizations that contributed to the diffusion of these words.
        Present any patterns or trends that emerge from your analysis.

    Visualizations:
        Include maps and other visual representations of the linguistic diffusion of spices. Explain the significance of these visualizations and how they support your findings.

    Discussion:
        Interpret the results of your analysis in the context of your research question and hypothesis.
        Discuss the implications of your findings for understanding the history and interconnectedness of global trade and cuisine.
        Reflect on the limitations of your study and potential areas for further research.
