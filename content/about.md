### The Name

*Aromatica* is the singular feminine or plural neuter nominative form of *arōmāticus* (a, um, adj.), meaning "composed of spice, aromatic, fragrant" {{< cite lewis_latin_1879 >}} [{{% icon book-open %}}](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=aromaticus), cf. Ancient Greek ἀρωματικός *arōmatikós* (adj.) 'aromatic', and the etymon ἄρωμα *árōma* (n.) "aromatic herb or spice" {{< cite liddell_greekenglish_1940 >}} [{{% icon book-open %}}](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frwma1).

The term therefore refers to any substance of fragrance, focusing on spices, but also includes incense, medicinal herbs, aromatic woods, oils and perfume, and other exotica[^1] with special olfactory and gustatory qualities.

[^1]: objects considered interesting because they are out of the ordinary, especially because they originated in a distant foreign country

### The Logo

{{< svg "static/images/svgs/borobudur-green.svg" >}}

The logo of Aromatica depicts the [Borobodur ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borobudur_ship), an 8th to 9th-century wooden double outrigger Javanese ship carved on the wall of the Borobodur temple (ꦧꦫꦧꦸꦝꦸꦂ). The ship is depicted as a symbol of the maritime trade routes across the Indian Ocean region, which connected the ancient world and allowed the spread of spices and other aromatics.
