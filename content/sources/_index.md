In what follows, you can find the main resources that were used while creating the database, and the rationale behind the selection. The first step was to try and assemble a list of spices that are relatively well-known, using materials and information gathered by professionals from various fields. The second step was to collate information on these materials, standardize our "master list", and conduct research on each. Along the way, new and less common materials would reveal themselves, and their addition would help the ultimate goal of an exhaustive, comprehensive list of spices.

Encyclopedias are a good starting point in any topic, and the *Encyclopaedia Britannica* does have a list of herbs and spices. Regarding the realm of plants, we relied on the book of South African botanist Ben-Erik van Wyk. For cultural and historical account, we turned towards the book of English historian and linguist Andrew Dalby. Finally, for a perspective from the culinary arts we used the book of Tony Hill, a spice merchant from Seattle.

The main challenge of collating different spice datasets is that the basis of comparison is not straightforward. Depending on discipline, sources identify spices by species name or common name, where the latter is always problematic since many spices have many different names and name variations.
