Welcome to Aromatica, a database containing information about spices, herbs, incense, and other aromatics.

The name *aromatica* is inspired by the words *exoticum* and its plural *exotica*. Aromatica is the singular feminine and the plural neuter nominative form of *arōmāticus* (f. *arōmātica*, n. *arōmāticum*), an adjective meaning "composed of spice, aromatic, fragrant" [(Lewis & Short, 1879)](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=aromaticus), cf. Ancient Greek *ἀρωματικός* arōmatikós adj. 'aromatic', and the etymon *ἄρωμα* árōma n. "aromatic herb or spice" [(Liddell–Scott–Jones, 1843)](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frwma1). 

In the past, these meanings included anything fragrant, including oils and perfume, and this website aims to collect the whole spectrum of materials with special olfactory and gustatory qualities.

The website is currently under construction, come back in 2024.
